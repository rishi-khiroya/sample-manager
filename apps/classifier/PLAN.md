# ML-Based Audio Sample Classifier Development Plan

This document outlines the steps to build the ML-based audio sample classifier component of the Sample Manager project. The classifier will analyze and tag audio samples to improve organization and retrieval.

## 1. Project Setup

- [ ] **Create the Project Structure:**
  - Ensure the following directory exists:
    ```
    /apps/classifier
    ├── BUILD
    ├── main.py
    ├── classifier_module.py
    └── data/
        └── (Place your audio samples and annotations here)
    ```
- [ ] **Initialize Virtual Environment & Dependencies:**
  - Set up a Python virtual environment (e.g., using `venv` or `conda`).
  - Install required packages (e.g., `tensorflow`, `numpy`, `librosa`, etc.).
  - Update the `requirements.txt` file with all dependencies.

---

## 2. Data Collection & Preprocessing

- [ ] **Gather Audio Data:**
  - Collect a diverse set of audio samples.
  - Consider using open datasets if available.
- [ ] **Annotation & Labeling:**
  - Define a set of labels/tags for classification.
  - Prepare a CSV or JSON file mapping audio file names to their labels.
- [ ] **Feature Extraction:**
  - Develop a script to extract audio features using Librosa (e.g., MFCCs, spectrograms).
  - Save preprocessed data for faster training.

---

## 3. Model Development

- [ ] **Baseline Model:**
  - Start with a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying audio samples based on spectrogram images.
  - Create a training script in `main.py` or a separate file.
- [ ] **Data Splitting & Preprocessing:**
  - Split your data into training, validation, and test sets.
  - Apply necessary normalization or augmentation to improve robustness.
- [ ] **Training & Evaluation:**
  - Write code to train the model.
  - Implement evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, etc.) and visualize training performance.
- [ ] **Experiment with Architectures:**
  - After the baseline, experiment with more advanced models (e.g., RNNs, Transformers, or fine-tuning pre-trained models).
  - Compare results and choose the best-performing architecture.

---

## 4. Integration with Core & Deployment

- [ ] **Expose Classifier as a Service:**
  - Develop an API endpoint (e.g., using Flask or FastAPI) that can accept audio samples and return classification results.
- [ ] **Integration Testing:**
  - Create test cases to validate that the classifier integrates well with the rest of the system.
  - Ensure it works with real-world samples and edge cases.
- [ ] **Documentation:**
  - Document the classifier’s API, training process, and usage instructions.
  - Update project documentation in the repository.

---

## 5. CI/CD & Further Improvements

- [ ] **Set Up Automated Testing:**
  - Write unit tests for preprocessing, model training, and API endpoints.
- [ ] **CI/CD Pipeline:**
  - Integrate the classifier build and tests into your monorepo CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, Travis CI).
- [ ] **Future Enhancements:**
  - Explore model quantization or optimization for faster inference.
  - Add logging, monitoring, and user feedback integration to improve the classifier over time.
