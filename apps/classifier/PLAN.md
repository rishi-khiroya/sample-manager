# ML-Based Audio Sample Classifier Development Plan

This document outlines the steps to build the ML-based audio sample classifier component of the Sample Manager project. The classifier will analyze and tag audio samples to improve organization and retrieval. We will use Poetry for dependency management and packaging.

## 1. Project Setup

- [ ] **Create the Project Structure:**
  - Ensure the following directory exists:
    ```
    /apps/classifier
    ├── pyproject.toml       # Managed by Poetry
    ├── README.md
    ├── classifier/         # Package folder (contains __init__.py, classifier_module.py, etc.)
    │   └── __init__.py
    ├── main.py             # Entry point for training/testing
    └── data/               # Place your audio samples and annotations here
    ```
- [ ] **Initialize Poetry & Virtual Environment:**
  - In the `/apps/classifier` directory, initialize a new Poetry project:
    ```bash
    cd apps/classifier
    poetry init --no-interaction
    ```
  - Add required dependencies such as TensorFlow, NumPy, Librosa, etc. For example:
    ```bash
    poetry add tensorflow numpy librosa
    ```
  - Activate the Poetry shell:
    ```bash
    poetry shell
    ```
- [ ] **Update the `.gitignore`:**
  - Ensure that the virtual environment (if generated locally) and any cache files are excluded. (Your root `.gitignore` should already cover common Python artifacts.)

## 2. Data Collection & Preprocessing

- [ ] **Gather Audio Data:**
  - Collect a diverse set of audio samples.
  - Consider using open datasets if available.
- [ ] **Annotation & Labeling:**
  - Define a set of labels/tags for classification.
  - Prepare a CSV or JSON file mapping audio file names to their labels.
- [ ] **Feature Extraction:**
  - Develop a script (e.g., within `classifier/preprocessing.py`) to extract audio features using Librosa (e.g., MFCCs, spectrograms).
  - Save preprocessed data to disk for faster training iterations.

---

## 3. Model Development

- [ ] **Baseline Model:**
  - Start with a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying audio samples based on spectrogram images.
  - Implement the model and training routines in `main.py` or within a dedicated module (e.g., `classifier/model.py`).
- [ ] **Data Splitting & Preprocessing:**
  - Split your data into training, validation, and test sets.
  - Apply necessary normalization or augmentation to improve robustness.
- [ ] **Training & Evaluation:**
  - Write code to train the model, and implement evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, etc.).
  - Visualize training performance with plots (e.g., using matplotlib).
- [ ] **Experiment with Architectures:**
  - Once you have a baseline, experiment with more advanced models (e.g., RNNs, Transformers, or fine-tuning pre-trained models).
  - Compare results and select the best-performing model.

---

## 4. Integration & Deployment

- [ ] **Expose Classifier as a Service:**
  - Develop an API endpoint using a lightweight framework such as FastAPI. Create an entry point (e.g., `classifier/api.py`) that accepts audio samples and returns classification results.
- [ ] **Integration Testing:**
  - Write test cases to validate that the classifier integrates well with the rest of the system (desktop and mobile apps).
  - Test with real-world audio samples to cover edge cases.
- [ ] **Documentation:**
  - Document the classifier’s API, training process, and usage instructions in a `README.md` within the `/apps/classifier` directory.
  - Update overall project documentation to reference how to use the classifier module.

---

## 5. CI/CD & Further Improvements

- [ ] **Set Up Automated Testing:**
  - Write unit tests for data preprocessing, model training, and API endpoints (using pytest, for example).
- [ ] **CI/CD Pipeline:**
  - Integrate the classifier build and tests into your monorepo’s CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, Travis CI).
- [ ] **Future Enhancements:**
  - Explore model optimization techniques (e.g., quantization, pruning) for faster inference.
  - Add logging and monitoring to track model performance in production.
  - Implement user feedback integration to improve the classifier over time.
