# Sample Manager Project Plan

This plan focuses on developing a sample manager inspired by ADSR's UI/UX while integrating custom ML models for sample classification and text-to-sample generation.

---

## 1. Refine Goals & UI/UX Requirements
- [ ] **Define UI/UX Priorities:**
  - List the key aspects of ADSR’s UI that you find compelling (e.g., ease-of-use, visual clarity, intuitive navigation).
  - Identify which elements are most relevant to your workflow (e.g., drag-and-drop sample organization, preview capabilities, tagging, and search functionalities).

- [ ] **User Journey Mapping:**
  - Outline the typical workflow for a producer (e.g., browsing samples, classifying them, generating new sounds from text, and using them in a DAW).
  - Create sketches or wireframes that mimic ADSR’s layout while incorporating areas for ML features (classification and generation).

---

## 2. System Architecture & Model Integration
- [ ] **Design a Modular Architecture:**
  - Create an abstraction layer for ML models (both classification and text-to-sample generation) to allow quick swaps and integrations.
  - Define the data flow: audio input → preprocessing (feature extraction) → ML inference → post-processing → UI update.

- [ ] **Select Tools and Frameworks:**
  - Choose your ML frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) and set up a plugin-friendly environment (consider JUCE for VST integration).
  - Decide on the stack for the desktop application (e.g., Electron, Qt, or native frameworks).

---

## 3. Data Collection & Preprocessing Pipeline
- [ ] **Gather & Annotate Audio Samples:**
  - Collect a diverse dataset that includes various sound types and metadata.
  - Develop scripts for feature extraction (e.g., using Librosa for generating spectrograms or MFCCs).

- [ ] **Set Up Data Validation:**
  - Define criteria for ensuring data quality (e.g., sample rate, noise levels, duration).
  - Test your preprocessing pipeline with a subset of your data.

---

## 4. ML Model Development
- [ ] **Prototype the Classification Model:**
  - Start with a baseline CNN model using spectrogram images and evaluate its performance on a validation set.
  - Experiment with advanced architectures (e.g., incorporating RNNs or Transformers) as needed.

- [ ] **Develop the Text-to-Sample Generation Module:**
  - Implement a simple baseline model (e.g., mapping text embeddings to audio feature space) and generate rudimentary samples.
  - Gradually experiment with more sophisticated generative models (GANs, VAEs, diffusion models).

- [ ] **Establish Evaluation Metrics:**
  - Define quantitative and qualitative metrics for both classification accuracy and generated audio quality (e.g., user ratings, fidelity metrics).

---

## 5. UI/UX Design & Integration
- [ ] **UI Prototyping:**
  - Develop interactive prototypes or wireframes inspired by ADSR’s layout.
  - Incorporate modules for sample browsing, previewing, tagging, and real-time ML-based feedback.

- [ ] **Integrate ML Modules with UI:**
  - Build connectors between the UI and your ML modules using REST APIs or direct library calls.
  - Implement asynchronous processing to handle model inference without blocking the UI.

- [ ] **Plugin Integration:**
  - Develop a VST plugin version that mirrors your desktop UI functionality.
  - Ensure that the plugin workflow (drag-and-drop, real-time preview, etc.) aligns with your core application’s design.

---

## 6. Testing, Iteration & Feedback
- [ ] **Unit and Integration Testing:**
  - Write tests for preprocessing, model inference, and UI interactions.
  - Run end-to-end tests using real-world sample libraries.

- [ ] **User Feedback Sessions:**
  - Organize sessions with producers to test the UI and overall workflow.
  - Iterate based on feedback to enhance usability and performance.

- [ ] **Performance Optimization:**
  - Monitor real-time performance, especially for the plugin, and optimize as necessary (e.g., model quantization, asynchronous calls).

---

## 7. Documentation & Deployment
- [ ] **Technical Documentation:**
  - Document the architecture, how to swap models, and the integration points between modules.
  - Provide developer guidelines for future contributions or model additions.

- [ ] **User Documentation:**
  - Create user guides and tutorials that explain how to use the sample manager and VST plugin.

- [ ] **Deployment Setup:**
  - Configure CI/CD pipelines for continuous integration and deployment (both for the desktop app and plugin).
  - Package your application in a way that supports easy updates and model swaps.
